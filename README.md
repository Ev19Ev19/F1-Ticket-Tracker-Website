About this project: 
This is a responsive landing page for Formula 1 fans who want to easily check race dates, see teams and drivers, and find tickets in one place. I built everything from scratch, using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and plain JavaScript for all the layout, design, and dynamic parts. What makes this version different is that I built it using Google Gemini Canvas to demonstrate how powerful AI can be when combined with my ideas.

Why I built it: 
I first tried to make a version of this site on my own, but it was limited in design and functionality. This time, I used AI as my coding partner. By working with Google Gemini Canvas, I could improve the structure, add better styling, and make it far more interactive than before. I built this project to show that a good idea can become a polished product much faster and better when AI is used thoughtfully. Formula 1 is something I enjoy following, so this was the perfect test project to explore that.

What I learned: 
Through this process, I learned how to get the most out of AI tools to speed up development while still understanding and controlling every part of the code. I improved my skills in HTML and Tailwind CSS, and became much more confident in writing dynamic JavaScript to handle things like date checks, section toggling, and updating content in a single-page app. More importantly, I learned firsthand how AI can help turn a rough concept into a professional-looking project in a fraction of the time.
